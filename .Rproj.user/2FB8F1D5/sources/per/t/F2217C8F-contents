# 3.2.5 Exercises
##1. In a single pipeline for each condition, find all flights that meet the condition:

### Had an arrival delay of two or more hours
### Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
### Were operated by United, American, or Delta
### Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
### Arrived more than two hours late but didn’t leave late
### Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight

## 2. Sort flights to find the flights with the longest departure delays. Find the flights that left earliest in the morning.

## 3. Sort flights to find the fastest flights. (Hint: Try including a math calculation inside of your function.)

## 4. Was there a flight on every day of 2013?

### 5. Which flights traveled the farthest distance? Which traveled the least distance?

### 6. Does it matter what order you used filter() and arrange() if you’re using both? Why/why not? Think about the results and how much work the functions would have to do.


# 3.3.5 Exercises

## 1. Compare dep_time, sched_dep_time, and dep_delay. How would you expect those three numbers to be related?
install.packages("nysflights13")
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
glimpse(nycflights13)

install.packages("nycflights13", type = "binary")
R.version.string

## 2. Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, and arr_delay from flights.


## 3. What happens if you specify the name of the same variable multiple times in a select() call?


## 4.  What does the any_of() function do? Why might it be helpful in conjunction with this vector?

variables <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay")


## 5. Does the result of running the following code surprise you? How do the select helpers deal with upper and lower case by default? How can you change that default?

flights |> select(contains("TIME"))


## 6. Rename air_time to air_time_min to indicate units of measurement and move it to the beginning of the data frame.


## 7. Why doesn’t the following work, and what does the error mean?

flights |> 
  select(tailnum) |> 
  arrange(arr_delay)

#> Error in `arrange()`:
#> ℹ In argument: `..1 = arr_delay`.
#> Caused by error:
#> ! object 'arr_delay' not found
